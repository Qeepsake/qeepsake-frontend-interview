#### Essential Requirements 

The aim of the task is to design the screen above.

- Start from a fresh React, React Native, etc project.
- There will be four journals with milestones: Sadie, Isabella, Peter and Jonathan. When a journal is pressed it will be selected and the milestones for that journal will show in the list.

The requirements of the project are intentially vauge as we want to allow space for creativity, building better solutions instead of following the instructions verbatim. Use the requirements as a guideline, but don't be afraid to provide out of the box solutions, and to go further than the requiremets in your project.

## Getting Started

You have one hour to complete this exercise.

- If you are using React Native then you just want to init a fresh react native application and go from there: `npx react-native init QeepsakeInterview` (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- If you are using React then feel free to use the toolset you are most confortable with: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) etc.
- All the data for journals and milestones can be found in `data/journals.json`.
- Other assets can be found in `/fonts` and `/images`.

Once you have completed your project, as stated above, upload to your Github, set to private, and add both [NMPHalpern](https://github.com/NMPHalpern), [lukebrandonfarrell](https://github.com/lukebrandonfarrell) [mpond531](https://github.com/mpond531) and [. Please also include instructions on how to run your project, if you didn't use React Native or create-react-app.
